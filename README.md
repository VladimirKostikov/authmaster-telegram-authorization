<h1>About this project</h1>

<p> This project is an intermediary between your web application and Telegram. If you need authorization on your webapp via Telegram, you can use this project absolutely free of charge.</p>

<p>From your web application redirects the user to the authorization page, where the user gets a code and a link to the bot</p>

<p>The user then sends an authorization token to the bot and validation takes place. If the code is correct, your webapp receives the user's JSON data from Telegram via the specified HTTPS NOTIFICATION. If the code is not valid, user will get an error</p>

<p>The last step is yours. It is necessary to process the received data to suit the needs of your project</p>
