Every time he logs in to a new site via Telegram, he will start a new correspondence with a new bot</li><li>The user must enter his phone number each time he logs in for the first time on a new site.</li><li>Strict implementation of the login button - no ability to change the template to suit the style of the site</li></ul>",

(There is no rule “1 site - 1 bot” as in the official widget)</li><li>No need to spend time setting up the bot. The bot is already configured, all you need is to confirm the rights to the site.</li><li>No need to start a new chat with a bot every time when logging in to a new site. One bot for all connected sites</li><li>Instead of a phone number, the user will only need to copy and paste a special key to authorize the chat with the bot. After this, authorization will occur</li><li>The login button can be styled as you wish.</li><li>Statistics. You can view the number of authorizations per day, month, year.</li><li>API tools for interacting with the application</li><li>Ability to disable/enable authorization through the settings panel.</li></ul>",
